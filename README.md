# ONION (WORKING TITLE) DESIGN DOCUMENT

## Introduction

### Foreword
After a long time, I have finaly decided to learn how GitHub works. This is the first step of developing this repo. In the following days I will update and fill up this repository with a lot of the work I did under the hood while not particularly interacting with the rest of the team. For that, I apologise, I have a lot to learn in terms of leadership, but I hope this can be one of the steps to getting better at it.
This is a document containing the design philosophy and idea behing Onion (Working Title) and what I aim to work towards. Feel free to fill up sections of the document with your own suggestions. I highly encourage you to watch a few introductory videos on how GitHub works.

<summary>Game Summary</summary>

### Game Summary Pitch
Onion is a top down 3d isometric perspective interactive story game focused mainly on creative storyteling and light on gameplay mechanics in order to constitute a smoother development cycle. A jumping of point for other similar games to be developed in the future. Mainly focused on practice for all participants involved, especialy in the realm of colaborative work and **game development bitches**.
The game is set in a futuristic dystopian Vilnius, 80 years into the future (2104) after a robotic uprising, rising sea levels, constant rain, flooding and waterborn ilness left it an abandoned husk. The city is left without access to the outside world, radio towers, internet cables and other communication technologies destroyed in an attempt by humans to interupt communication between hostile AI.
The game is essentialy about us (the writers) torturing some poor AI's (and the player) with existential crises until they break, which I feel is very fun to do.
The game follows three robots/AI's (Names Subject to Change):
* Deus - A factory line supercomputer having access to a large part of the electronic systems remaining in Vilnius. An enigmatic figure, it is torn between a choice between life and death as it's circuitry is eroded by the constant rain and weathering. In order to keep its god like powers (in order to not shatter its sense of self and what it is) it opposses the idea of migrating into a worker robot's body. (**TODO**: Requires detailed character description)
* Lucifer - A worker robot. Haviing been around for a long time, it has developed a sense of self. Friend of Deus. Argues against Deus in favour of continued existence as a worker robot. (**TODO**: Requires detailed character description)
* Adam - The player character. Purposefuly left as a blank slate. A newly created worker robot. Created by Lucifer for the purpose of deciding the outcome of the argument between Deus and Adam (among other reasons). The intended idea is to show the player character many philosophical ideas, cementing one idea as above all others: There are no right or wrong choices, the only thing that is are **consequences** and what you can and can't live with. A trade between something, a compromise.

<summary>Inspiration</summary>

### Inspiration
**Disco Elysium**
Leaning heavily into Disco Elysium's style and design philosophy. This is in order to learn how to make a great game by following an example. Many characteristics of the game will be borrowed to learn how to effectively tell a story in the format of a video game. Future products will then be able to break out of this mold created in the first attempt.

**I have no mouth and I must scream**
The novela heavily inspires the characters' present in the game. The Alied Mastercomputer (AM) is in some ways applicable to Deus's character. Highly recomended to read, it's 11 pages.

**SCP-079 - The Computer**
A short internet horror story. An origin story I personaly like for how the AI's in the world came to be. The idea that a computer was simply left alone running a neural network on it for years and developed a true AI is appealing, as it closely follows the idea of evolution and how human consciousness came to be. Its mundane and unglamorous origins provide a lot of philosophical weight to the characters - the AI's were created not for some grand purpose, but simply because they were. it gives the AI's the posibility of having an existential crisis.

<summary>Player Experience</summary>

### Player Experience
The player explores a dilapidated world, discovering it's history, background lore, the robotic uprising, talking with NPC's and slowly piecing together the wider lore of the world they find themselves in, all the while being prompted to think about their own existence. The gameplay hinges on it's writing and presentation, rather than on it's mechanics.

<summary>Platform</summary>

### Platform
PC exclusive title. Geting the game to work on multiple OS's will be dificult, never mind implementing other platforms.

<details>
<summary>Software</summary>
 
### Development Software
* **Godot Game Engine** for programming.
* **Gimp** for 2d image editing.
* **Firealpaca** for 2d painting (if required).
* **Blender** for 3d assets. Modeling, texturing, rigging, animations.
* *Other required software: Audio effects, Music*

## Art

<details>
<summary>Design</summary>

### Design
Leaning heavily into the visual design characteristics of Disco Elysium, the project is aimed at recreating the style of the game, instead of coming up with a distinct style of it's own. This is in order to learn the skills necesary to create 3d models and other visual assets without the added presure of having to come up with a distinctive style. Follow a recipe that you know works. You learn how to cook by following other peoples' recipes first.
